# 👅 TongueBalance AI

> **"Shàng yī zhì wèi bìng" (上医治未病)** — The superior doctor prevents disease before it arises.

**TongueBalance AI** is a proactive wellness application developed for the **Gemini 3 Hackathon**. It bridges thousands of years of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) wisdom with cutting-edge Multimodal AI to provide users with a non-invasive, personalized health assessment through simple tongue analysis.

## 🌟 Overview

In TCM, the tongue is considered a window into the body's internal state. Changes in tongue color, shape, and coating can indicate imbalances long before physical symptoms appear. **TongueBalance AI** leverages **Gemini 3 Pro** to "see" these subtle indicators and provide actionable lifestyle and dietary recommendations.

### Key Features

* **AI Multimodal Analysis:** Real-time visual analysis of tongue body and coating using Gemini 1.5 Pro.
* **Personalized Wellness Plans:** Custom dietary advice (foods to include/avoid) based on identified TCM patterns (e.g., Damp-Heat, Qi Deficiency).
* **Preventative Philosophy:** Focuses on "balancing" the body rather than just treating symptoms.
* **Qi Cultivation Integration:** Dynamic recommendations for traditional movements like **Ba Duan Jin (八段锦)** and **Jin Gang Gong (金刚功)**.
* **Progress Tracking:** (MVP Concept) Monitor how your "internal vibe" changes over time.

## ⛩️ The Philosophy: 上医治未病

This project is built on the core TCM principle that health is a state of balance.

> "The superior doctor prevents disease. The mediocre doctor treats the disease before it becomes evident. The inferior doctor treats the full-blown disease."

By providing an accessible tool for daily self-reflection, we empower users to make small adjustments to their diet and lifestyle to maintain harmony and prevent illness.
